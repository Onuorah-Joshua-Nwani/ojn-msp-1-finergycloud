# Clean Branch Setup - Delete and Recreate

## Step 1: Delete the Web Platform Branch
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Onuorah-Joshua-Nwani/ojn-msp-1-finergycloud
2. Click on "Branches" tab
3. Find the "web-platform" branch
4. Click the trash icon to delete it

## Step 2: Revert Main Branch (Remove Web Platform Files)
1. Go to your main branch
2. Click on "Commits" to see history
3. Find the merge commit that added web platform files
4. Click "Revert" to remove the web platform files from main branch

## Step 3: Prepare Fresh Web Platform Files
1. Ensure you have the latest web platform files in your development environment
2. Organize all project files properly
3. Verify all configurations are complete

## Step 4: Create New Web Platform Branch
1. Go back to your GitHub repository
2. Create a new branch called "web-platform-standalone"
3. Upload only the web platform files to this new branch:
   - client/ folder
   - server/ folder
   - shared/ folder
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json
   - vite.config.ts
   - tailwind.config.ts
   - tsconfig.json
   - drizzle.config.ts
   - components.json
   - postcss.config.js
   - README.md
   - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   - .env.example
   - .gitignore

## Step 5: Commit the Clean Branch
Commit message: "Add FinergyCloud Web Platform - Standalone Branch"

## Final Result
- **Main branch**: Your original mobile app and static website (clean)
- **Web-platform-standalone**: Only the web platform files (clean)
- Perfect separation for independent deployment

This approach gives you the cleanest separation possible!
