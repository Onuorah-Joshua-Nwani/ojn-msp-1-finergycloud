# How to Update the Am I Responsive Mockup for FinergyCloud

## Current Status
The current mockup image (`documentation/rm-images/amiresponsive.png`) shows the old version of the website. We need to update it to reflect the new FinergyCloud AI-driven renewable energy investment platform.

## Steps to Update

### 1. Visit Am I Responsive Website
Go to [https://ui.dev/amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)

### 2. Enter Your Website URL
- Input: `https://onuorah-joshua-nwani.github.io/ojn-msp-1-finergycloud/`
- Or if using custom domain: `https://www.finergycloud.com`

### 3. Capture the Updated Mockup
The tool will automatically generate a responsive mockup showing:
- **Desktop view**: Full hero section with AI-driven messaging
- **Laptop view**: Navigation and platform overview
- **Tablet view**: Mobile-optimized layout
- **Mobile view**: Touch-friendly interface

### 4. What the New Mockup Should Show

#### Key Visual Elements:
- **Updated Hero Section**: "AI-Driven Risk Intelligence for Renewable Investors"
- **New Navigation**: FinergyCloud logo as main brand (no separate "Home" tab)
- **Modern Design**: Green/teal color scheme with professional styling
- **Value Proposition**: Clear positioning as renewable energy investment platform
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: "Explore MVP" and "Pitch Deck" buttons

#### Expected Content Visible:
- FinergyCloud branding with "AI Risk Intelligence" tagline
- Hero title mentioning AI-driven risk intelligence
- Timeline showing 2022-2025 journey
- Professional, modern fintech design
- Responsive layout across all device sizes

### 5. Save and Replace
1. Download the new mockup image from Am I Responsive
2. Save it as `amiresponsive.png`
3. Replace the existing file in `documentation/rm-images/amiresponsive.png`

### 6. Verify the Update
The new mockup should clearly show:
- ✅ FinergyCloud as the main brand/logo
- ✅ AI-driven renewable energy investment messaging
- ✅ Modern, professional design
- ✅ Proper responsive layout
- ✅ Updated navigation structure
- ✅ Current hero section content

## Alternative Method

If you prefer to take screenshots manually:

### Desktop Screenshot
- Open the website in a desktop browser
- Capture the full hero section showing the AI-driven messaging

### Mobile Screenshot
- Use browser developer tools or actual mobile device
- Capture the mobile-optimized layout

### Tablet Screenshot
- Use browser developer tools set to tablet dimensions
- Capture the tablet layout

### Combine Screenshots
Use image editing software to create a composite mockup similar to Am I Responsive format.

## File Location
Replace the existing mockup at:
```
documentation/rm-images/amiresponsive.png
