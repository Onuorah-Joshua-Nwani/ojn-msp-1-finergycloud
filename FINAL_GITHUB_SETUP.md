# Final GitHub Setup - Connected Repository

## Current Status
✅ Connected to GitHub repository: ojn-msp-1-finergycloud
✅ On branch: web-platform-v2 (complete web platform)
✅ Web platform running successfully with database

## Next Steps for Clean Separation

### Option 1: Use Current Branch (Recommended)
Since you're already on `web-platform-v2`:
1. Keep this as your web platform branch
2. Rename it to `web-platform-standalone` (optional)
3. Deploy from this branch
4. Keep main branch for mobile app only

### Option 2: Push to New Branch
```bash
# Create new clean branch
git checkout -b web-platform-standalone
git push -u origin web-platform-standalone
```

### Option 3: Clean Up Main Branch
If main branch has web platform files mixed in:
1. Switch to main branch
2. Remove web platform files manually
3. Keep only mobile app and static website files

## Repository Structure (Final)
- **main**: Mobile app + static website
- **web-platform-v2** or **web-platform-standalone**: Complete web platform
