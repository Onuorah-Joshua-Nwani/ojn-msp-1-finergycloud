## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

The FinergyCloud Power BI dashboard serves as a visual analytics layer for our renewable energy investment platform. It transforms complex financial data, risk assessments, and ESG metrics into intuitive visualizations that enable investors to:

- Evaluate project performance at a glance
- Compare multiple investment opportunities
- Understand risk factors and their potential impact
- Track ESG compliance and sustainability metrics
- Make data-driven investment decisions

### Target Audience

The dashboard is designed for:

1. **Investment Professionals**: Fund managers, analysts, and portfolio managers
2. **Project Developers**: Renewable energy project teams
3. **ESG Specialists**: Sustainability and compliance officers
4. **Financial Institutions**: Banks and credit providers

## Data Architecture

### Data Model

The dashboard is built on a structured data model with the following tables:

1. **Projects**: Core project metadata
   - Project ID (primary key)
   - Project name
   - Project type (solar, wind, hydro, etc.)
   - Location
   - Capacity (MW)
   - Investment amount
   - Start date
   - Status

2. **Financial Metrics**: Performance indicators
   - Project ID (foreign key)
   - IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
   - NPV (Net Present Value)
   - Payback period
   - ROI (Return on Investment)
   - LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy)

3. **ESG Scores**: Environmental, Social, Governance metrics
   - Project ID (foreign key)
   - Environmental score
   - Social score
   - Governance score
   - Overall ESG score

4. **Risk Assessment**: Risk factors and scores
   - Project ID (foreign key)
   - Grid stability risk
   - Regulatory risk

5. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probability distribution data
   - Project ID (foreign key)
   - Simulation run ID
   - Simulated IRR

### Data Relationships

The data model uses a star schema with the Projects table as the central fact table:

```
                  ┌─────────────────┐
                  │ Financial Metrics│
                  └────────┬────────┘
                           │
                           │
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────┴─────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│   ESG Scores    │──┤  Projects ├──┤ Risk Assessment │
└─────────────────┘  └─────┬─────┘  └─────────────────┘
                           │
                           │
                  ┌────────┴────────┐
                  │Monte Carlo Sim  │
                  └─────────────────┘
```

### Data Sources

For the MVP implementation, data is sourced from:
