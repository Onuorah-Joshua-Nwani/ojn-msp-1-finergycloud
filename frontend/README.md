# FinergyCloud Frontend

This React application provides a simple dashboard interface that communicates with the Flask backend. It was created manually (without running `create-react-app`) to keep the project lightweight.

## Setup

1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Builds are generated with `npm run build` and served by the Docker container in production.
