# Git Commands to Add Web Platform to Your Repository

## Step 1: Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Onuorah-Joshua-Nwani/ojn-msp-1-finergycloud.git
```

## Step 2: Create a new branch for the web platform
```bash
git checkout -b web-platform
```

## Step 3: Add all files to git
```bash
git add .
```

## Step 4: Commit the web platform
```bash
git commit -m "Add FinergyCloud Web Platform

```

## Step 5: Push the new branch to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin web-platform
```

## Alternative: If you want to add to a subdirectory in main branch
```bash
# Instead of creating a branch, create a subdirectory
mkdir web-platform
# Move all files to web-platform/ directory
# Then:
git add web-platform/
git commit -m "Add web platform in web-platform directory"
git push origin main
```

## Repository Structure After Adding Web Platform

Your repository will have:
```
ojn-msp-1-finergycloud/
├── mobile-app/          # Your existing mobile app
├── web-platform/        # New web platform (if using subdirectory approach)
├── assets/              # Existing assets
├── documentation/       # Existing documentation
└── other existing files...
```

OR with branches:
- `main` branch: Your existing mobile app and website
- `web-platform` branch: Complete web platform application

## Recommended Approach: Use Branches

I recommend using the branch approach because:
1. Keeps your existing mobile app untouched on main branch
2. Allows separate development of web platform
3. Easy to switch between mobile and web platform
4. Can merge later if desired
5. Clean separation of concerns

## After Pushing

1. You'll see the new branch on GitHub
2. You can create a Pull Request to merge to main (if desired)
3. Set up deployment for the web platform branch
4. Update your main README to mention both platforms

Run these commands in your terminal to add the web platform to your GitHub repository!
