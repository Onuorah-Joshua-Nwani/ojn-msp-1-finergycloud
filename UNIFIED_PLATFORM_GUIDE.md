## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
```javascript
// Shared API for Web and Mobile
app.get('/api/projects', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  // Same endpoint serves both web platform and mobile app
});

// Cross-platform authentication
app.post('/api/auth/login', (req, res) => {
  // JWT tokens work for both web and mobile
});

// Mobile-specific endpoints
app.get('/api/mobile/sync', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  // Mobile synchronization features
});
```

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Web platform routing
<Route path="/" component={UnifiedLanding} />
<Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />

// Mobile app deep linking
const openInMobile = (feature) => {
  const mobileUrl = `finergycloud://feature/${feature}`;
  window.location.href = mobileUrl;
};

// Cross-platform feature detection
const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768;
const suggestMobileApp = isMobile && !isWebPlatform;
```

### Mobile App Integration Points

#### Deep Linking
```javascript
// From web to mobile app
const openInApp = () => {
  window.location.href = 'finergycloud://dashboard';
};

// From mobile app to web
const openInWeb = () => {
  Linking.openURL('https://www.finergycloud.com/dashboard');
};
```

#### Data Synchronization
```javascript
// Shared data models
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // ... same structure for web and mobile
}

// Sync API
POST /api/sync/upload    // Mobile uploads changes
GET  /api/sync/download  // Mobile downloads updates
```
